“You’re going to get stuck.”  This was something reiterated by my mentors from our first sessions.  When you’re learning to code you’re not only learning new languages, which is a challenge in and of itself, you’re also learning different methods of logic and problem solving.  You can’t just plug numbers into an equation.  You have to understand a whole system and then figure out the best way to shape your code in order to get the desired outcome.

The “stuck” moments have been the most challenging part of learning.  As a beginner, it is easy to feel like an idiot when you can’t figure out why your code isn’t working.  Without having my mentors to support me and show me how to troubleshoot, I think I may have given up on my coding pursuits. 

There are a few things I would emphasized if I could go back and give my beginning-coding-self some advice:

* Learn by writing
  The Bloc folks gave this advise but I didn't really listen to it.  I was too focused on finishing checkpoints. Take notes and then write out what you understand from the checkpoints in your own plain langauge. 
  
* Ask for help
  If after an hour or two (max), you're still stuck with a problem then you need to stop googling and contact your mentor or speak with other students on slack
  
* Have patience
  Learning a new skill is challenging and takes time.  Expect to work through problems.  It's okay if it takes longer than you're expecting to learn a new concept.
  
  Learning how to code involves learning a whole new way of thinking and problem-solving. That's part of the great thing about.  It can be super frustrating but the more I push through the more my mind begins to expand.
