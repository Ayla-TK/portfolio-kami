My elementary school had an annual school-wide science fair.  When I was in the 5th grade, the “world wide web” was just beginning to interest the public. My dad, a software engineer, decided this would be my science project for the year. I would learn HTML and create my very own website. This project not only got me an award at the science fair but a spot on the local news!

Getting this early start in coding, you would think that I would be a rock star developer by now. But unfortunately, shortly after my coding success, I became a teenager that lost interest in learning how to develop websites and more interested in the social aspect of the web.  

For the past decade, I’ve regretted not sticking with programming.  I’ve even complained to my father that he should pushed and encouraged me to pursue a skill no so valued in today’s workforce.  

My career is in marketing and communications and my education in public health.  Over the years, I have been given the important task of getting health promotion and disease prevention information to public.  We don’t just need the public to hear or see the information but we also need them to take actions for their own health.  In this modern world, the internet is the ubiquitous form of communication.  I’ve worked with many web developers to create the sites we needed to share with the public.  

Often I would find myself in frustrating meetings with developers not understanding our needs or not being able to create a site due to budget or simply not being able to change one or two simple things on the site and needing to wait until the developer was available.  In these moments, my feelings of regret would return and I’d think “If only I knew how to code.”

A couple years ago I found myself working at a hi-tech company, still as a marketer.  Now I was not only managing websites but also promoting technology and applications.  This often led me to write and promote different user interface features and even suggest things that would be easier for the user.  While I was working closer with developers, I still had no idea how applications were built and by web development had not progressed beyond my fifth-grade HTML lessons from my father.  When I found myself saying “If only…”, I realized it really wasn’t too late. So I set a goal to learn how to code by 2020.  

While I have hopes that coding will enhance my career and will be glad to have a portable skill set in my pocket, the decision to learn to code wasn’t about pursuing a career in web development. Rather, it was about acquiring an empowering tool that could be the vehicle for my ideas to be shipped out into the world.  

For me, coding is about creativity and having the skills at my finger tips to share my creations, stories, or services with others.
